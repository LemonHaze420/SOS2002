The following are *not yet functional*


New Race / Single Race

Clicking on the car name cycles between the different cars: i.e. clicking on
"Mercedes 125" changes to "Mercedes 154". This car will then use the 154.
Clicking on the driver name changes to the next driver of the car. I.e.
clicking on "Gunter Schmidt" changes to the next skin (driver).

Load Game

When the user clicks on the filename (currently only "none" is available),
the name of the filename will appear on the left as it is selected. I.e.
clicking on a label (on the right side) saying "Montlhery start" will
make a field appear in the (currently blank) left side, saying "Montlhery
Start".
Load game will load in the saved game and return the user either to the
Select Track screen, or the Championship screen, depending on when the 
game was saved.

Delete game will delete the saved game, after requesting confirmation
("REALLY delete game?")

Save Game
As Above.


Replay Options

Clicking on the Replay Slot will update the stats on the left side. These
will be (as an example)
Replay Name:  Good Montlhery Replay
Replay Track: Montlhery
Cars in Replay: 1x Mercedes Benz 154, 1x Auto Union C

The above text refers to the replay currently in memory. There is also
text below this which refers to the currently selected replay, which 
will be loaded or replaced.

Load Replay loads a replay into memory to be shown.
Save Replay overwrites the selected replay with the replay currently 
in memory.

Show Replay starts the replay.
