Avus Track Build Method

Stage 1:
Clone REFERANCE Trees with Spline(if no spline selected  trees go haywire).
Move selection to desired location.
Take central spine and collapse all in modifier stack.

Check to see if linkage is still working

Stage 2:
Clone COPY lofts and align with tree spline.
Modify all lofts replace PATH with new collapsed spine.[use modify panels settings]

Check to see if linkage is still working.



To modify track, select central spline [oject name spline modifyX]
Open modify panel and activate subobject POINTS.
The original points can be edited by highlighting and using the basic move tool.
To add points to spline use refine tool
